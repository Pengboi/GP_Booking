ESSENTIAL NOTES: MoSCoW Priority Ranking
Make sure to make sure that the username of a new created user CANNOT be "logout" as this is used in messaging system to return toolbar to home toolbar --> Not sure if relevant
S:	Once system finished, add encryption to database files using small console file --> Maybe tie in with setup process 
S:	Refactor button txt & image sources to be defined within view. View components should be displayed in view and should technically count as xaml definable not dependant on VM or code
	(unless logic is required such in the case of the current time/date labels, current signed in user labels and etc.)
